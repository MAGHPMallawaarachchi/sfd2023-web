# HELP

## Use this react icon ```TbChevronRight```


## If you want to use Roboto Mono font, type this Tailwind class ```font-mono```


## Don't use custom colors. Make sure to view the ```tailwind.config.js``` file to see the colors that are available.


## All images can be found in the ```public/images``` folder. Make sure to use the ```next/image``` to declare the images.


## Use ```<Container> </Container>``` to wrap your content. This will make sure that the content is centered and has a max-width of 1200px except for images that use up the whole width of the screen.
